This repository contains two Python programs, an advance calculator and a contact book, developed for a first-year university assessment. Both programs utilize OOP principles to ensure better code management and scalability.
Project Strucutre:
  Advance Calculator files:
    ScientificCal.py  # Main file with simple and advance calculator functions
    SciCalGraph.py    # Functions of graphs
    UnitConverter.py  # Unit conversion functions
  Contact Book files:
    THEcontactBOOK.py  # Main file
    ClassGUI.py        # User interface and functioning of the contact book
    ClassDatabase.py   # Management of data storage in MySQL database
Advance Calculator Features:
  Carries out advance mathematical functions including trignometric and logarithmic function.
  Allows graphs to be generated to visualize data and analyze graph co-ordinates.
  Supports range of unit conversions in categories lenght, weight, temperature and angle.
  Includes checks for invalid mathematical operations preventing crashes due to division by zero or incorrect inputs.
Contact Book Features:
  Provides add, update, view/search and delete contact functions with seperate pop up windows for add/update features.
  Contacts can be searched using different data including name, phone number or email address.
  When adding/updating contacts, input data are checked to make sure correct inputs are provided (such as phone number having numberical values and email containing address '@' and certain fields cannot be left empty)
  Confirmation messsages are displayed as neccessary.
I'm always looking to enhance my coding skills so if you have any insights, suggestions or best practices, I'd love to hear them! Your input is greatly appreciated.
